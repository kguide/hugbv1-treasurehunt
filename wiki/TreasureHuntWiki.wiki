=Introduction=
This page is for documentation and notes regarding project Treasure Hunt which is being worked on as a part of Hugbúnaðarverkefni 1, a course in Computer Science at the University of Iceland.

=Individual To-Do list=

This is a list of what each team member is doing at the moment.

  * *Agnar* is working on making the splash screen appear for a few seconds and then having the Log In screen appear.
  * *Hörður* is working on a background image as well as creating a paper mock-up of playing a game on the Android.
  * *Mannsi* is working on the google code side of things. 
  * *Ragnar* is working on a paper mock-up of playing a game on the Android.

=Group To-Do list=

Each of needs to get up to speed on the following subjects 
  * Test Driven Development using the Android platform. Klaus gave us a few pages regarding this subject as well as showing us an example in class. Seeing as we are planing on using TDD, this needs to be done asap.
  * Getting used to Subversion and checking out/adding some code in the googlecode repository. This also needs to be done asap. 
  * Deciding on an architecture for the project. This means defining classes and packages on a high-level basis.

==Time Management==

We each need to figure out how much time we can spend on this project and how long each part of the project is taking. This needs to be done on a daily basis and needs to be as accurate as possible. Please not that all time spent reading about material regarding your project should be included as well as all the coding work .

=Coding Conventions=

The following are suggestions regarding our projects coding conventions.

  * All methods and variables should use Camel-writing unless they are constants
  * Constants should be written in all caps (THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT_NAME)
  * The Android 'global variables start with m' should be avoided. 
  * All code should include Java Doc commenting style. This will save a lot of time

=Architecture=
The following are classes/interfaces that we expect will be implemented.

==GUI==
  *Splash-Screen-class
  * Log-In-class
  * Welcome-Screen-class
  * Game-Play-Gui-class (This needs the be split up)
  * Advanced-Menu-class
  * Help-Menu-class
  * Settings-Menu-class
  * Find-a-Game-class
  * Select-a-Game-class
  * Your-Score-class
  * High-Score-class
 
==Control==
  * Player-class
  * Game-interface
  * Game-classes

==DAL==
  * DB-class

==Networking==
  * Networking-class

==GPS==
  * GPS-communication-class

==Create a Game - Simple Game==
A player logs on to our website and wants to create a game. He selects the 'Create Game' button and starts by choosing Hallgrímskirkja as the starting position. He wants the players to start within the church so he assigns a small radius for the starting position. He then selects Hlöllabátar near Ingólfstorg as his next location and then he puts three clues that the players can use to get to that location. He would like for the radius of this location to be 50 meters. The next location is in Kópavogur (just pick some house in Kópavogur) and he adds two clues that should help the players get there. This is the final destination.

==Play a Game - Simple Game==
A player logs on using his HTC Magic Android Phone. He selects 'Play' and from a list of games he is playing he selects 'Simple Game'. He is now informed that he has finished reached 0 of a total of 3 locations in this game. He is also informed that the starting position is Hallgrímskirkja (this is revealed to him on a map). The player then goes to Hallgrímskirkja where he receives confirmation that he has reached the first location and then he receives clue A1. He doesn't understand this clue so he requests another clue, A2. He understands this clue and goes to Hlöllabátar near Ingólfstorg. There he gets a confirmation that he has reached the second location and he then receives clue B1. He understands this clue and goes to some place in Kópavogur where he is informed that he has finished the game.

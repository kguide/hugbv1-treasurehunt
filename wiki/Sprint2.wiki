=Sprint meeting=

We will do the following during the sprint meeting tomorrow (13.10.09)

  * Define a logical sprint goal.
  * Decide which stories are appropriate for the sprint goal.
  * Decide which of the appropriate stories we can handle during the sprint.
  * Break down the selected stories into tasks and guestimate how long each task is going to take.

=Sprint 2 in general=

This sprint is going to be very different from the first one. Since we have gotten a good feeling for the Android platform, we are going to be able to produce much more code this sprint. However, there is one important thing that we need to fix from Sprint 1. We need to log all time we spend on this course. This is a must. So we are all going to have to log the time spent and I (Mannsi) will collect this accumulated logged time during each sprint meeting.

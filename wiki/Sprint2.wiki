=Sprint Goal=
Our sprint goal is to be able to create and play a simple game. It's very important that we focus on making this happen. Complex features that will f.x. enhance gameplay should be postponed until this is achived. This does not mean that we will create crappy code that somehow works but it does mean that we will have to evaluate if what we are doing is really helping us achive our sprint goal. 

=Time Management=

We need to log all time we spend on this course. This is a must. So we are all going to have to log the time spent and I (Mannsi) will collect this accumulated logged time during each sprint meeting. 

=Time per member=
This is a log of team members time spent on the project.
  * Mannsi - 13 hours
  * Hörður - 8 hours 
  * Ragnar - 3.5 hours
  * Agnar - 15 hours
